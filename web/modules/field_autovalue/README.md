# Field Autovalue

Field Autovalue allows fields to be configured to have custom values generated automatically whenever the entities they belong to are saved.

It does so by exposing a plugin system which allows fields to be configured to use a specific plugin to generate the automatic value.

The module does not provide any plugins (except inside the test module).
